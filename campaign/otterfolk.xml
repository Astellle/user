            <h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
            <p>A small, fur-covered creature that comes in various shades of brown, including black, gray, and even white on occasion. They tend to have small claws and sharp teeth that are for eating alone as these beings have learned how to develop and use tools.</p>

          <h4>HISTORY</h4>
            <p>Otterfolk were created when a wizard gave human intelligence to a normal otter. The otter escaped into the wild and bred with a normal otter, passing its intelligence on to its offspring. Eventually their bodies evolved to suit their intelligence, and they became bipedal and grew thumbs.</p>

          <h4>SOCIETY</h4>
            <p>The Otterfolk control large portions of rivers and even entire bays where rivers meet the sea. The only place where Otterfolk aren’t found is around the waters of large swamps that Lizardfolk, their natural enemy, reside in.</p>
