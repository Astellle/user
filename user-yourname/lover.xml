		    <p>You've always had a special kind of charm on people. For some reason, people see you as an ideal candidate for an evening of fun, or a lifelong partner. This ... skill ? ... gave you a rather strange point of view on life.</p>
		    <p class="indent">  It might be a good idea to see with your DM the list of cities and towns in which you have lovers and determine who these lovers are beforehand for a more smooth introduction of their characters in the game.</p>

					<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Persuation and Performance</li>
					<li><strong>Tool Proficiencies:</strong> Thieves tools or Herbalist's pack or Disguise kit</li>

            <p>People of your preferred sex (or not!) seem to be constantly attracted to you romantically or sexually. Because of this, you may end up in strange, potentially troublesome situations. In every place humanoids gather, you will be accosted at least once per week you remain there by an NPC looking to become your lover. This interest can be purely physical or romantic. The NPC can already be engaged/married or not. They might be honest with you or not. Enjoy the best curse in the world !</p>
